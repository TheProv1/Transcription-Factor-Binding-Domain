HOW TO RUN

Note: In both the codes, change the BASE_FOLDER variable to the location where the dataset is actually present

1. run the DBD-Splitting-Code first
    This code extracts the DBD region from the main file and stores it separately in the same location as the scripts are

2. Next run the DBD-Disorder-Code
    This code creates a .txt file which will contain all the transcription factors having a higher disorder score from 
    the threshold. Disorder % = (amino acids (IU > 0.5) / total number of amino acids in the DBD region)
